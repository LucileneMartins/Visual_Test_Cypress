### Commands

`cypress-image-diff -u ` - Notice that you should run this command after the test suite runs. The below command will only update baseline images that have a diff image, which basically means a test failure.

`cypress-image-diff-html-report start `: to serve the HTML report out of a generated JSON file in an interactive mode, where you can update the baseline screenshots.

`cypress-image-diff-html-report generate `: to generate and write to disc the HTML report in case you just want to view the static report.

` Updating baseline images`  - you can delete the baseline image cypress-image-diff-screenshots > baseline ,
that you wish to be updated and rerun the tests by running the `npm run cy:open`,
this will create a new baseline image with the updated image.
